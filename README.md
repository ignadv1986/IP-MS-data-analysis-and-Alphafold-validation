# IP-MS-data-analysis-and-Alphafold-validation
Processing data generated by mass spectrometry of immunoprecipitation (IP-MS) samples and gaining insights into detected protein–protein interactions through AlphaFold3.

**Note:** The intend of this project is not to present novel finding. All data shown here has been previously descibed in [this publication](https://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/fulltext/S1097-2765(25)00309-0). The purpose of this repository is to showcase different bioinformatics skills, including mass spectrometry data analysis, presentation and interpretation, as well as characterization of protein interaction with Alphafold3 - including structure visualization, sequence retrieval and confidence assessment.
## Tools
- **Python 3**: Processing and filtering of pre-analyzed IP-MS data (via Google Colab).
- **GraphPad PRISM:** generation of graphical representations.
- **Adobe Illustrator:** figure polishing and layout.
- **[Uniprot](https://www.uniprot.org):** protein sequence retrieval.
- **Alphafold3:** characterization of protein interaction through the [Alphafold server](https://alphafoldserver.com).
- **ChimeraX:** Structure visualization, chain isolation, sequence mapping, and pLDDT score extraction.
- **[PAE viewer](https://pae-viewer.uni-goettingen.de):** Generation and annotation of PAE plots.
## Workflow
1) **Data Filtering & Categorization:**
- IP-MS data (Z-scores and p-values for all sample comparisons) was pre-analyzed.
- Filtering was done in Python (Google Colab).
- A false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.01 was applied, and the FDR threshold was calculated per comparison.
- Proteins were categorized based on enrichment status.
- Enriched proteins in WT samples (vs. either mutant) were filtered for further analysis.
2) **Visualization of Enrichment:**
Volcano plots were generated in GraphPad PRISM for the key comparisons.
3) **Protein Sequence Retrieval:**
Sequences for proteins of interest — CRAMP1 and GON4L — were retrieved from:
CRAMP1 [(Q96RY5)](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q96RY5/entry)
GON4L [(Q3T8J9)](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q3T8J9/entry)
4) **AlphaFold3 Modeling:**
- The CRAMP1–GON4L interaction was predicted using AlphaFold3 via the public server.
- Full-length sequences were submitted to generate a complex model.
5) **Structure Processing in ChimeraX:**
- The predicted model was analyzed using ChimeraX (daily build).
- Chain IDs were confirmed and interacting regions isolated.
- pLDDT scores and sequences were extracted and mapped.
- The structure was colored by confidence and used to identify interacting regions.
6) **PAE Plot Generation:**
- PAE plots were generated via PAE Viewer.
- Interaction-specific regions were highlighted, exported as .png, and further annotated in Adobe Illustrator.
7) **Focused Modeling of Interacting Regions:**
- Only the predicted interacting regions were resubmitted to AlphaFold3 to improve visualization clarity.
- The same analysis steps (as above) were repeated for this subset.
