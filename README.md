# IP-MS-data-analysis-and-Alphafold-validation
Processing data generated by mass spectrometry of immunoprecipitation (IP-MS) samples and gaining insights into detected protein–protein interactions through AlphaFold3.

**Note:** The intend of this project is not to present novel finding. All data shown here has been previously descibed in [this publication](https://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/fulltext/S1097-2765(25)00309-0). The purpose of this repository is to showcase different bioinformatics skills, including mass spectrometry data analysis, presentation and interpretation, as well as characterization of protein interaction with Alphafold3 - including structure visualization, sequence retrieval and confidence assessment.
## Background
Using a CRISPR/Cas9 screen, we identified CRAMP1 as a novel regulator of the cellular response to Topoisomerase II (TOP2) inhibitors in human cells. Further analysis revealed that CRAMP1 promotes the expression of linker histone H1, thereby enhancing chromatin compaction. This compaction restricts TOP2 binding and reduces its trapping following treatment with TOP2 inhibitors.
To gain insight into the molecular mechanism by which CRAMP1 mediates these effects, we used AlphaFold to model its structure. The predicted structure revealed the presence of a SANT-like domain and a bipartite fold domain (D1–D2), suggesting potential functional modules involved in chromatin regulation.

To study CRAMP1 interactions, we generated cell lines stably expressing GFP-tagged CRAMP1 (wild-type and deletion mutants lacking either the SANT or the D1 domain). These lines were subjected to immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (IP-MS). The resulting data were pre-processed to calculate Z-scores and p-values for protein enrichment.
## Aims of the project
- Identify novel CRAMP1-interacting proteins.
- Determine whether the SANT and D1 domains contribute to specific protein interactions.
- Validate selected interactions using AlphaFold3 structural predictions.
## Tools
- **Python 3**: Processing and filtering of pre-analyzed IP-MS data (via Google Colab).
- **GraphPad PRISM:** generation of graphical representations.
- **Adobe Illustrator:** figure polishing and layout.
- **[Uniprot](https://www.uniprot.org):** protein sequence retrieval.
- **Alphafold3:** characterization of protein interaction through the [Alphafold server](https://alphafoldserver.com).
- **ChimeraX:** Structure visualization, chain isolation, sequence mapping, and pLDDT score extraction.
- **[PAE viewer](https://pae-viewer.uni-goettingen.de):** Generation and annotation of PAE plots.
## Workflow
1) **Data Filtering & Categorization:**
- IP-MS data (Z-scores and p-values for all sample comparisons) was pre-analyzed.
- Filtering was done in Python (Google Colab).
- A false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.01 was applied, and the FDR threshold was calculated per comparison.
- Proteins were categorized based on enrichment status.
- Enriched proteins in WT samples (vs. either mutant) were filtered for further analysis.
2) **Visualization of Enrichment:**
Volcano plots were generated in GraphPad PRISM for the key comparisons.

3) **Protein Sequence Retrieval:**
Sequences for proteins of interest — CRAMP1 and GON4L — were retrieved from:
CRAMP1 [(Q96RY5)](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q96RY5/entry)
GON4L [(Q3T8J9)](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q3T8J9/entry)

4) **AlphaFold3 Modeling:**
- The CRAMP1–GON4L interaction was predicted using AlphaFold3 via the public server.
- Full-length sequences were submitted to generate a complex model.
5) **Structure Processing in ChimeraX:**
- The predicted model was analyzed using ChimeraX (daily build).
- Chain IDs were confirmed and interacting regions isolated.
- pLDDT scores and sequences were extracted and mapped.
- The structure was colored by confidence and used to identify interacting regions.
6) **PAE Plot Generation:**
- PAE plots were generated via PAE Viewer.
- Interaction-specific regions were highlighted, exported as .png, and further annotated in Adobe Illustrator.
7) **Focused Modeling of Interacting Regions:**
- Only the predicted interacting regions were resubmitted to AlphaFold3 to improve visualization clarity.
- The same analysis steps (as above) were repeated for this subset.
## Results
We performed IP-MS on CRAMP1 wild-type (WT) and two deletion mutants lacking either the SANT or D1 domains. The mass spectrometry data, pre-processed to compute Z-scores and p-values, was filtered using Python. Proteins enriched in WT samples (compared to SANT or D1) were identified using a false discovery rate of 0.01.
Among these, GON4L was the most significantly enriched protein in both WT and SANT samples when compared to the D1 mutant, indicating a D1 domain-dependent interaction (Figure 1 and Figure 2).

GON4L is known to localize to Histone Locus Bodies (HLBs) — subnuclear compartments also associated with CRAMP1. Given this spatial overlap and the functional relevance in H1 regulation, we investigated the interaction further using AlphaFold3.
We modeled the CRAMP1–GON4L complex using the full-length sequences of both proteins via the public AlphaFold3 server. The predicted complex revealed a potential interface, though the overall model confidence was low, as indicated by pLDDT coloring and the PAE plot (Figure 3 and Figure 4).

Using insights from the PAE plot, we isolated interacting regions:
CRAMP1: residues 300-800
GON4L: residues 1455–2024
These fragments were re-modeled in AlphaFold3, producing a fragment-based model with markedly improved confidence. The fragment PAE plot showed tighter alignment at the predicted interface (Figure 5), while the pLDDT map confirmed the improved quality of the model (Figure 6).

Additionally, we visualized the structure colored by chain (Figure 7), allowing clearer interpretation of the interaction geometry.

To quantify model confidence, we compared mean pLDDT and the percentage of high-confidence residues (pLDDT > 70) across the full and fragment models (Figure 8 and Figure 9). The fragment model had both higher average confidence and a greater proportion of well-modeled residues.

🔹 [Figure 8. Mean pLDDT comparison: full vs. fragment model](./graphs/Full_protein_VS_fragments_mean_pLDDT.pdf)
🔹 [Figure 9. % of residues with pLDDT > 70: full vs. fragment model](./graphs/Full_protein_VS_fragments_pLDDT>70.pdf)

Together, these results support the presence of a direct, confidently modeled interaction between CRAMP1 and GON4L, dependent on the D1 domain of CRAMP1. The focused AlphaFold3 prediction of the interacting fragments provides higher-resolution structural insight, reinforcing the functional relevance of this interaction.
